    <section>
        <p>Just follow a couple of conventions to track tasks; append your (estimates) and {actuals} to your card names
            with parentheses and braces, like this:</p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/card-example.png"/>

        <p>Scrumpy will keep totals at the top of each column and update them every few seconds as you work:</p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/totals-example.png"/>

        <p>When you're ready to see some charts, there's a new "Stats" button in the top right menu bar:</p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/stats-button-example.png"/>

        <p>All you need to enter is the sprint duration (in work days &mdash; not including weekends) and the start date
            (Scrumpy will remember these for each board):</p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="images/parameters-dialog-example.png"/>

        <p>Then, you'll see a simple burndown chart and a few other stats:</p>

        <h2>Assumptions</h2>

        <p>Scrumpy does make a few assumptions about the way your team works (#sorrynotsorry):</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>You work Monday to Friday (weekends are factored out)</li>
            <li>You use three columns: pending, in-flight and done (but call them whatever you like)</li>
            <li>If you run your stats in the morning, you want to report up to yesterday, but if you run them in the
                afternoon, you want to include today too
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Shortcomings</h2>

        <p>Scrumpy is pretty new and is missing some stuff you might want/need, although it'll be added fairly soon:</p>
        <ul class="bullets">
            <li>Accurate burndown chart (<a
                    href="https://github.com/davidjgoss/scrumpy/milestones/Accurate%20burndown%20chart">milestone</a>)
            </li>
            <li>More stats (<a href="https://github.com/davidjgoss/scrumpy/milestones/More%20stats">milestone</a>)</li>
            <li>Cards listing and export (<a
                    href="https://github.com/davidjgoss/scrumpy/milestones/Cards%20listing%20and%20export">milestone</a>)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are also <a href="https://github.com/davidjgoss/scrumpy/labels/bug">a few bugs</a> I'm working through.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Privacy</h2>

        <p>Scrumpy doesn't modify any of your Trello data itself or even access it directly; instead, it just relies on
            your team using the notation for estimates and actuals, and finds all the data it needs in the page. Because
            of this, there's a pretty low chance of Scrumpy conflicting with another extension/plugin or breaking when
            Trello.com changes.</p>

        <p>Scrumpy is a standalone extension; it doesn't send your data anywhere. Durations and start dates you enter
            for boards are saved within Chrome for convenience, but that's it.</p>

    <section>
        <h2 class="heart-trello">Trello</h2>

        <p>Trello is awesome! If you're a heavy user, consider paying $5 a month for <a href="https://trello.com/gold">Trello Gold</a> to get more features
            and help support a great product and company.</p>
